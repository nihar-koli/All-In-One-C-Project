# All-In-One-C-Project

This is my first project I ever made in C.

-> In this project, you will get different options like Basic Programs, Arrays, 2D Matrices, Strings.
-> Out of which you have select one.
-> After selecting one you will get a variety of different programs under that choice.
-> By just giving inputs you can get the output for every program...(Any program just by making choice)

-> How to run this project:-

Note:- This project is made for TURBO CPP only**. If you want to run it in different compiler then you will have to make corresponding changes.

1.Place NIHAR.H (Header file) in "C:\TURBOC3\INCLUDE" folder.
2.Place SPAPRJ.C (Main file) in "C:\TURBOC3\Projects" folder.
3.Open SPAPRJ.C in Turbo CPP.
4.You are ready to ROCK and ROLL.

-> I made this project to learn how to create header file and use it.
-> Hence I wrote All the C programs in header file. And now I can Run any program by just including this header file in my main .c file.

-> I made this project for fun and to clear my basic concepts of C programming language...
